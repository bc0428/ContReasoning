two sets of experiments
1. atom then implication
2. opposite

both with new optimizer

compare
1. within to validate if learning atoms first is better
2. with baseline to see if baseline is actually worse

random sampling for recall, but the learning sequence itself has no randomness, just deterministic two stage learning
